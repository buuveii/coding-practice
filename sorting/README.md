# Sorting

## Bubble sort(バブルソート)
### Time complexity 
O(n^2)
### Space complexity
O(1)
### Stability 
No



## Selection sort(選択ソート)
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest
element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list

### Time complexity 
O(n^2)
### Space complexity 
O(1)
### Stability
No

### Selection sort is used when
* small list is to be sorted
* cost of swaping does not matter
* checking of all the elements is compulsory



## Insertion sort(挿入ソート)
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places unsorted element at its suitable place at each iteration

### Time complexity
Best O(n)
Average O(n^2)
### Space complexity
O(1)
### Stability
Yes

### Insertion sort is used when
* the array has small number of elements
* only few elements left to be sorted



## Merge sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on Divide and Conquer Algorithm

### Time complexity
O(n*log n)
### Space complexity
O(n)
### Stability
Yes



## Quicksort
Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that is based on Divide and Conquer Algorithm. An array is divided into subarrays by selecting pivot element. While dividing the array, elements less than pivot are kept on the left side of pivot and elements greater than the pivot are kept on the right side of pivot. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.

### Time complexity
Average O(n*logn) Worst O(n^2)
### Space complexity
O(log n)
### Stability
No



## Heap sort


### Time complexity
O(n*logn)
### Space complexity
O(1)
### Stability
No
