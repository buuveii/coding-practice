# Sorting

## Bubble sort(バブルソート)
### Time complexity 
O(n^2)
### Space complexity
O(1)
### Stability 
No



## Selection sort(選択ソート)
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest
element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list

### Time complexity 
O(n^2)
### Space complexity 
O(1)
### Stability
No

### Selection sort is used when
* small list is to be sorted
* cost of swaping does not matter
* checking of all the elements is compulsory



## Insertion sort(挿入ソート)
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places unsorted element at its suitable place at each iteration

### Time complexity
Best O(n)
Average O(n^2)
### Space complexity
O(1)
### Stability
Yes

### Insertion sort is used when
* the array has small number of elements
* only few elements left to be sorted



## Merge sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on Divide and Conquer Algorithm

### Time complexity
O(n*log n)
### Space complexity
O(n)
### Stability
Yes







### Time complexity
### Space complexity
### Stability
